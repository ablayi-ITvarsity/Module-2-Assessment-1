                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>A 45-kilo adult (and pandas can reach 150 kg in captivity) spends as long as 14 hours eating. And it can eat 12 to 38 kilos of bamboo a day.
                        Pandas' favorite food is bamboo shoots. If you do the Panda Keeper Tour, which I can personally recommend, you too can eat bamboo, although what you eat will be cooked for you first.</p>
                    <p>We all know them as eating only bamboo, but they like some fruit too, and can eat meat.</p>
                    <p>Although they still have sharp teeth and the digestive tract of carnivores, they don't have the energy to chase anything, so their prey would virtually have to land in their lap, or be injured and too slow to escape.</p>
